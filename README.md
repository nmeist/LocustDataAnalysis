# Locust Data Analysis

Before running the Jupyter notebook, input the location of 'locust_posture_data_ds.h5'.

This notebook will create a folder titled "./plots" that contains the subfolders with plots produced from the code:
- ./plots/AFMB:
- ./plots/FB:
- ./plots/LR:
- ./plots/pairwise:
    - Before a change from paused to moving occurs, what do the previous pairwise interactions look like?
    - Histogram that shows distribution of the length of the individual pairwise interactions
